NAME
    Net::DHCP::Packet - Object methods to create a DHCP packet.

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::DHCP::Packet;
            use strict;

            my $p = new Net::DHCP::Packet('Chaddr' => '0??BCDEF', 
                                    'Xid' => hex(0x9F0FD),
                                    'Ciaddr' => '0.0.0.0',
                                    'Siaddr' => '0.0.0.0', 'Hops' => 0);

DESCRIPTION
    Represents a DHCP packet as specified in RFC 1533, RFC 2132.

  CONSTRUCTORS

    new
    discover
    request
    decline
    release
  METHODS

    op(BYTE opcode)
            Sets the opcode in the BOOTP type.
            Without argument, returns the BOOTP type.
            Argument is either:
            Net::DHCP::Packet::BOOTREQUEST()        { pack('C',0x1) }
            Net::DHCP::Packet::BOOTREPLY()  { pack('C',0x2) }

    htype(BYTE hardware address type)
            Ex. '1' = 10mb ethernet

    hlen(BYTE hardware address length)
            For most NIC's, the MAC address has 6 bytes.

    hops(BYTE number of hops)
            This field is incremented by each encountered DHCP relay agent. 
        
    xid(C4 transaction id)
            4 byte transaction id.

    secs(SHORT elapsed boot time)
            2 bytes for elapsed boot time.

    flags(SHORT)
            2 bytes. 
            0x0000 = No broadcasts.
            0x1000 = Broadcasts.

    ciaddr(IP address)
            IP address is an ascci string like '10.24.50.3'.
        
    yiaddr(IP address)
    siaddr(IP address)
    giaddr(IP address)
    chaddr(MAC address) Hexadecimal string represenatation. Example:
    "0010A706DFFF" for 6 bytes mac address.
    sname(C64 servername)
            Optional 64 bytes null terminated string with server host name.

    file(C128 bootfilename)
            Optional

    options(REF Net::DHCP::Options)
                    Argument is reference to a Net::DHCP::Options object.
                    Without argument, returns the Options object.

    addOption($type, $value)
    getOption($type)
    new(%ARGS)
            The hash %ARGS  can contain any of these keys:
            Op, Htype, Hlen, Hops, Xid, Secs, Flags, Ciaddr, Yiaddr, Siaddr, 
            Giaddr, Chaddr, Sname, File
        
    discover
            DHCP discover packet

    request
            DHCP request packet
        
    decline
            DHCP decline packet

    release
            DHCP release packet

    serialize
            Converts a Net::DHCP::Packet to a string, ready to put on the network.

    marshall(string)
            The inverse of serialize. Converts a string, presumably a 
            received UDP packet, into a Net::DHCP::Packet.

    toString()
            Returns a textual representation of the packet, for debugging.

BUGS
    I only ran some simple tests on Windows 2000 with a W2K DHCP server and
    a USR DHCP server. Not yet tested on Unix platform.
